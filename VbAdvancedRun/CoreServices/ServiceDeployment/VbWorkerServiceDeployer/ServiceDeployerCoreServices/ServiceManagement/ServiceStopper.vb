    ''' <summary>
    ''' Handles the stopping of a Windows service in a controlled and safe manner.
    ''' This class is responsible for sending the stop control code to the service and ensuring the service stops gracefully.
    ''' If the service fails to stop, it utilizes error handling services to report and manage the failure.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The stopping process is initiated by sending the <see cref="ServiceControlCodes.Stop"/> control signal to the service.
    ''' If the service fails to stop, the <see cref="IErrorHandlingService"/> is used to handle Win32 errors.
    ''' The class ensures that any necessary clean-up actions are performed if stopping the service does not succeed.
    ''' 
    ''' It is important that the service handle passed to this class is valid and that proper permission is available to control the service.
    ''' The handle must be obtained using the appropriate Win32 functions like <c>OpenService</c>.
    ''' 
    ''' This class ensures a clean shutdown of the service and may throw exceptions depending on the implementation if stopping the service fails.
    ''' </remarks>
