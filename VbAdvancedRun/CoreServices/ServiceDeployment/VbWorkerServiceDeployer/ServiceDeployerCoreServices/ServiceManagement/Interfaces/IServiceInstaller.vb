    ''' <summary>
    ''' Defines the contract for a service installer.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The <see cref="IServiceInstaller"/> interface specifies the contract for classes responsible for 
    ''' installing services. Implementations of this interface should provide the detailed logic for 
    ''' installing a service, ensuring that the installation process is completed correctly and that 
    ''' the service is properly registered with the system.
    ''' 
    ''' Implementing classes are expected to handle all aspects of service installation, including
    ''' configuring necessary settings and managing dependencies. The interface ensures that all service 
    ''' installers conform to a consistent contract, facilitating integration and management of services 
    ''' across different parts of the application.
    ''' 
    ''' The <see cref="IServiceInstaller.InstallServiceAsync"/> method is central to this contract, and it 
    ''' is used to initiate the installation process. Implementing classes should ensure that this method 
    ''' performs the required actions to install the service and return an appropriate status indicating 
    ''' the success or failure of the operation.
    ''' </remarks>

        ''' <summary>
        ''' Installs the service asynchronously.
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <returns>
        ''' A task that represents the asynchronous operation. The task result contains <c>True</c> if the service was installed successfully; otherwise, <c>False</c>.
        ''' </returns>
        ''' <remarks>
        ''' The <see cref="InstallServiceAsync"/> method should implement the logic required 
        ''' to install a service, including any necessary configuration and setup steps. The method is 
        ''' expected to return <c>True</c> upon successful installation of the service, indicating that 
        ''' the service has been correctly set up and registered. If the installation fails or encounters 
        ''' issues, the method should return <c>False</c> to signal that the process was not completed 
        ''' successfully. This allows the caller to handle any errors or take appropriate actions based 
        ''' on the success or failure of the service installation.
        ''' </remarks>
