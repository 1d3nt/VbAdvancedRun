        ''' During investigation, it was found that the <see cref="NativeMethods.DeleteService"/> function did not throw an error even when encountering

        ''' deletion to proceed successfully, indicating that full access rights are necessary for the deletion operation. This behavior suggests that 
        ''' <see cref="DeleteService"/> does not throw an exception on ACCESS_DENIED but instead returns a failure result that must be handled explicitly.
