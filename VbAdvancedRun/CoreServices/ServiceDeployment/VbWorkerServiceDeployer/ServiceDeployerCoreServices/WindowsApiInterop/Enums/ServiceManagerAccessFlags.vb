    ''' <summary>
    ''' Specifies the access rights for the service control manager (SCM).
    ''' These flags are used to define the desired access when calling <see cref="NativeMethods.OpenSCManager"/>.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The <see cref="ServiceManagerAccessFlags"/> enumeration specifies the different access rights that can be requested when interacting with the service control manager.
    ''' 
    ''' The following bullet points map the <see cref="ServiceManagerAccessFlags"/> enum values to their C++ equivalents:
    ''' <list type="bullet">
    '''     <item><description><see cref="Connect"/> corresponds to the constant <c>SC_MANAGER_CONNECT</c> in C++.</description></item>
    '''     <item><description><see cref="CreateService"/> corresponds to the constant <c>SC_MANAGER_CREATE_SERVICE</c> in C++.</description></item>
    '''     <item><description><see cref="EnumerateService"/> corresponds to the constant <c>SC_MANAGER_ENUMERATE_SERVICE</c> in C++.</description></item>

    ''' 
    ''' Note: Although this enum maps to specific access rights used with the service control manager, there is no direct C++ enumeration 
    ''' that matches these values. The enum members are used to specify the required access rights in Windows API functions such as 
    ''' <see cref="NativeMethods.OpenSCManager"/>. Some members are marked with <see cref="UsedImplicitlyAttribute"/> because they are 
    ''' not directly referenced in the current code, but are retained for completeness and potential future use.
