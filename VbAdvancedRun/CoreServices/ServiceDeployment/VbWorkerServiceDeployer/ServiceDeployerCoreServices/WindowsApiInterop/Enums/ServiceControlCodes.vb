    ''' <summary>
    ''' Defines control codes for the <see cref="NativeMethods.ControlService"/> function, used to send control commands to a service.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The <see cref="ServiceControlCodes"/> enumeration specifies the different control codes that can be sent to a service to request specific actions or status updates.
    ''' 
    ''' Although there is no direct C++ enumeration that matches these values, similar control codes are used in Windows API functions.
    ''' For example, in C++ code, you might use these constants with API functions such as <c>SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP</c> or <c>SERVICE_CONTROL_PAUSE</c>.
    ''' 
    ''' Note: Although some values may not be used in the current implementation, they are included for completeness and potential future needs.
