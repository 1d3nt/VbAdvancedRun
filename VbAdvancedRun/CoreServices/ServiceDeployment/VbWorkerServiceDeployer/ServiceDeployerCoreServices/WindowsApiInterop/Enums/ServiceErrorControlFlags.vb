    ''' <summary>
    ''' Defines the severity of the error if the service fails to start during boot.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The <see cref="ServiceErrorControlFlags"/> enumeration specifies how the operating system handles errors that occur when a service fails to start during the boot process.
    ''' 
    ''' Although there is no direct C++ enumeration that matches these values, similar error control flags are used in Windows API functions.
    ''' For example, in C++ code, you might use these constants with API functions such as <c>CreateServiceA</c>.
    ''' 
    ''' The following bullet points map the <see cref="ServiceErrorControlFlags"/> enum values to their C++ equivalents:
    ''' <list type="bullet">
    '''     <item><description><see cref="ServiceErrorIgnore"/> corresponds to the constant <c>ERROR_CONTROL_IGNORE</c> in C++.</description></item>
    '''     <item><description><see cref="ServiceErrorNormal"/> corresponds to the constant <c>ERROR_CONTROL_NORMAL</c> in C++.</description></item>
    '''     <item><description><see cref="ServiceErrorSevere"/> corresponds to the constant <c>ERROR_CONTROL_SEVERE</c> in C++.</description></item>
    '''     <item><description><see cref="ServiceErrorCritical"/> corresponds to the constant <c>ERROR_CONTROL_CRITICAL</c> in C++.</description></item>
    ''' </list>
    ''' 
    ''' Note: Although some values may not be used in the current implementation, they are included for completeness and potential future needs.
