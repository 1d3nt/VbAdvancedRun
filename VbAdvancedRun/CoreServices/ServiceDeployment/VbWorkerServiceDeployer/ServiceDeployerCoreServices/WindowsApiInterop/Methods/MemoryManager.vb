    ''' <summary>
    ''' Provides utility methods for managing unmanaged memory in P/Invoke operations.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' This class contains methods to handle common operations related to unmanaged memory management,
    ''' such as freeing memory if it is not null. It is marked as <c>NotInheritable</c> to
    ''' prevent inheritance and ensure that the utility methods are used as intended.
    ''' 
    ''' Although this class is not currently used in the project, it is included as part of the P/Invoke template
    ''' that is used for every P/Invoke project, and is kept for completeness and potential future use.

        ''' <remarks>
        ''' This method checks if the provided <paramref name="memoryPointer"/> is not equal to <see cref="NativeMethods.NullHandleValue"/>.
